# ModuloExperimentation
Tests for three implementations of Modulus: Addition only, Multiplication then addition, and arg1-arg1//arg2*arg2   
All results were output to an .csv (comma separated value) file. I took that file and made a graph in Excel.     
Spoiler alert: the one implementation without any looping was fastest. Amazing, I know.
